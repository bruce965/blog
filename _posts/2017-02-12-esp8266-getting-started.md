It's been two months since I decided to buy a few of this tiny devices from AliExpress. They have a built-in WiFi module and they can be programmed from Arduino IDE. And they arrived this week. üòÑ

So, after they joy of finally touching with my hands what I had been waiting for so long, the first question came to my mind... How do I actually program it?

## Programming the ESP8266 ESP-12F

Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager) integration. Link to the latest version is at the moment `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`, copy-paste it in the *boards manager*.

> Note: you can find the *boards manager* configuration at *File ¬ª Preferences ¬ª Additional Boards Manager URLs*. After pasting the link, you can install the board from *Tools ¬ª Board: "Arduino" ¬ª Boards Manager... ¬ª esp8266 ¬ª Install*.

And now comes the challenge: there is no USB port and it doesn't tolerate 5V. So how can we connect it to the computer? And how can we power it?

Fortunately I have an *Arduino Uno* that can be used to program the ESP8266. The builtin 3.3V voltage regulator is not powerful enough to power the chip, so we need an external power supply. Just connect according to the following table.

> Note: either **remove the *ATMEGA* chip** from the Arduino **or flash something "inhert" before connecting** the *ESP8266*; we don't want random serial data to flow between the devices. I flashed the *Blink* sketch and everything worked, but anything that doesn't use the serial port should be fine.

ESP8266 ESP-12F | Arduino | Power Supply | Notes
----------------|---------|--------------|------
RXD0            | RX      |              | Through resistive voltage divider
TXD0            | TX      |              |
GPIO0           |         |              | Switch to GND, pull-up to 3.3V
GPIO2           |         | 3.3V         |
GPIO15          |         | GND          |
GND             | GND     | GND          |
RST             | RESET   |              | To use Arduino built-in reset button
EN              |         | 3.3V         |
VCC             |         | 3.3V         |

> Warning: *RX* pin on the *Arduino* outputs 5V. The *ESP8266* only accepts 3.3V, **never connect the RXD0 and RX pins directly**!

> Note: *RX* pin on the *Arduino* is actually the *TX* pin for the computer, and *TX* pin is actually *RX*. If you use a *USB to Serial* adapter you must swap this pins.

If you don't have a 3.3V power supply, you can use two 1.5V AA batteries in series.

## Testing ESP8266 From The Serial Port

Before proceeding any further, you should test your device by setting *GPIO0* to high (3.3V) and opening a serial console to your Arduino (*Tools ¬ª Serial Monitor* from the Arduino IDE). You will be "talking" to both the ATMEGA (if still connected to the board) and the ESP8266, but the ATMEGA will not reply.

Set baud rate to *"115200 baud"* and new-line mode to *"Both NL & CR"*.

> Note: boot message is transmitted at *74800 baud*, this is the reason you get some garbage before useful information while listening at a different rate.

Check if everything is working with the `AT` command. The *ESP8266* should reply with *"OK"*.

```text
AT

OK
```

> Note: if ESP8266 replies with *"ERROR"* or doesn't reply at all, you should stop and check your voltages and settings. Are all connections good? Is *RXD0* pin at about 3.3V? Is *TX* pin at 3.3V? Did you set new-line mode to *"Both NL & CR"*?

Enter *Access Point* mode with `AT+CWMODE=2`.

```text
AT+CWMODE=2

OK
```

![Serial console connected to the ESP8266](esp8266-esp_serial.png)

Set the access point to be an open access point on channel 5 with *SSID* *"esp_test"* by typing `AT+CWSAP="esp_test",,5,0`.

```text
AT+CWSAP="esp_test",,5,0

OK
```

Enable connection multiplexing with `AT+CIPMUX=1`.

```text
AT+CIPMUX=1

OK
```

Enable test TCP server on port *80* with `AT+CIPSERVER=1,80`.

```text
AT+CIPSERVER=1,80

OK
```

You can check *ESP*'s IP address with `AT+CIFSR` command. It will always be *192.168.4.1* in access point mode.

```text
AT+CIFSR
+CIFSR:APIP,"192.168.4.1"
+CIFSR:APMAC,"5e:cf:7f:2b:8a:8a"

OK
```

You can now search for WiFi networks from your phone. *"esp_test"* network will be visible. If you open your web browser and visit `http://192.168.4.1/` a message will appear on the serial console‚Ä¶ that's an HTTP request.

```text
0,CONNECT

+IPD,0,311:GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.4.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Android 5.1.1; Mobile; rv:51.0) Gecko/51.0 Firefox/51.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

Before connection times out, you can reply with `AT+CIPSEND=0,6` command, followed by a 6 bytes message.

```text
AT+CIPSEND=0,6

OK
> banana
busy s...

Recv 6 bytes

SEND OK
```

Your message will appear in the web browser as soon as you terminate the server with `AT+CIPSERVER=0`.

## Uploading a Sketch

Set *GPIO0* to low (*GND*), power your ESP and connect your Arduino to the PC.

Launch your Arduino IDE and load the *Blink* sketch from *File ¬ª Examples ¬ª ESP8266 ¬ª Blink*. If you have an *ESP-12* model you will have to replace `LED_BUILTIN` with another value; use `12` for *GPIO12* pin.

Set your board settings according to the following image‚Ä¶

![Arduino IDE settings to connect to ESP8266 modules](esp8266-arduinoide_esp_settings.png)

> Tip: you might want to enable "compile" and "upload" output from *File ¬ª Preferences ¬ª Show verbose output during: ¬ª compilation; upload*.

Now compile and upload the program, and keep your finger on the reset button on the *Arduino* board‚Ä¶ tap it as soon as the message changes from *"Compiling sketch..."* to *"Uploading..."*.

> Note: only tap the reset button once, do not tap it twice or the upload will fail.

You can check if everything worked by pulling *GPIO0* high; resetting again; and probing *GPIO12* with a multimeter. It should keep jumping between 3.3V and 0V every second.

## Next Steps

Now have an ESP8266 programmer with serial connection. You can start playing with the examples and build your very own IoT device.

> Tip: the ESP8266 comes with built-in WiFi, it can join your home network and can be controlled from your computer with just the web browser. That's for less than 2‚Ç¨ (in both the price and the size of the coin), how cool is that?
