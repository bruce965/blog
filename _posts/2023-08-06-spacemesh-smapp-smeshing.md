So you have decided to join [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/), huh?

That's wonderful to hear!

But you need some guidance?

No problem, I'm here to help! Like many other smeshers waiting for you to
[join Spacemesh on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yVhQ7rC)!

This step-by-step guide will teach you how to smesh.

Ready? Let's get started!

{: .prompt-tip }

## Prerequisites

The requirements to join the Spacemesh network are minimal:

- A modern-ish computer, any computer built in the last 8 years should be okay
- At least 256 GB of free space available, permanently committed to Spacemesh
- Just for one time: a gaming GPU, low-end is okay but high-end will be faster

If you don't have a gaming GPU, you can also ask a friend to lend you their
gaming computer for a while, I have also written a
[step-by-step guide to do smeshing from a friend's computer]({% post_url 2023-08-26-spacemesh-smeshing-with-friends %}).

If you don't have a gaming GPU and you don't have any friends with a gaming GPU,
you can also do it with a CPU, just keep following this guide, but be warned:
it might take a long time (up to a few days) and will end up wasting few KWh
in electricity.
If you have means to do it with a GPU you really should, it's better for the
environment and takes much less time; and remember, it's a one-time operation.


## Installing SMAPP

You can download the latest version of SMAPP from the
[Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) website.

!["Join the Network" button](smesh-1-join-light.png){: .light .shadow w='947' h='435' }
!["Join the Network" button](smesh-1-join-dark.png){: .dark .shadow w='947' h='435' }
_After visiting the [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) website, click the "Join the Network" button._

![Download buttons](smesh-2-download-light.png){: .light .shadow w='973' h='345' }
![Download buttons](smesh-2-download-dark.png){: .dark .shadow w='973' h='345' }
_Then, click your operating system's button._

Run the setup to install SMAPP, you can leave all options to the default values.

![SMAPP installation: user](smesh-3-setup-1.png){: .shadow w='499' h='388' }
_Install only for your user._

![SMAPP installation: path](smesh-3-setup-2.png){: .shadow w='499' h='388' }
_Leave the default installation path._

![SMAPP installation: run](smesh-3-setup-3.png){: .shadow w='499' h='388' }
_Click "Finish" to start SMAPP._


## Creating a Wallet

Once SMAPP is configured, it's time to create a wallet.
This is where your coins will be stored.

![SMAPP: setup](smesh-4-wallet-1.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Click "Setup" to start the SMAPP setup._

![SMAPP: new wallet](smesh-4-wallet-2.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Click "Wallet + Node" to create a new wallet, and a node to start smeshing._

![SMAPP: wallet type](smesh-4-wallet-3.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Unless you have a hardware wallet, click "Standard Wallet"._

![SMAPP: network](smesh-4-wallet-4.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_This screen allows you to switch to a test network; don't do it, just click "Next"._

### Password

![SMAPP: password](smesh-4-wallet-5.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_It's now time to pick a password._

> Please, please, please take note of this password. Write it somewhere in
> multiple copies, get it tattooed on your skin, or just somehow make it
> absolutely sure that you will never forget it.
> **If you lose your password you will lose your wallet and all the coins that**
> **it contains!** Please, do everything you can not to lose your password!
{: .prompt-warning }

> And also, you should not reveal your password to anyone you don't absolutely
> trust. So... perhaps it's not really a good idea to get it tattooed.
{: .prompt-tip }

![Windows' firewall](smesh-4-wallet-6.png){: .shadow w='527' h='381' }
_If you are on Windows, you will get a firewall alert; select all options and click "Allow access"._

### 12 Words

Now that you have chosen a password, SMAPP will take one extra precaution to
make it a bit harder for you to lose it: SMAPP will generate 12 random words
that represent a copy of your wallet.

These words are a copy of your wallet, not protected by any password.

![SMAPP: 12 words](smesh-4-wallet-7.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Take note of these 12 random words, treat them as securely as your password._

> Basically, if you lose your wallet (your wallet is a file) or if you lose its
> password, you can always use these 12 random words to recover it.
>
> When you recover a wallet from the 12 random words, SMAPP asks you to set a
> new password immediately, so these 12 words are not a replacement for your
> wallet + your password, they are just a safeguard mechanism.
{: .prompt-tip }

> These 12 words contain a copy of you wallet, treat them as securely as your
> password. That means you shouldn't reveal them to anybody you don't trust.
{: .prompt-warning }

To make sure that you took note of your 12 random words, SMAPP will randomly ask
you for 4 of them.

![SMAPP: confirm 12 words](smesh-4-wallet-8.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_SMAPP will ask you to confirm that you saved your 12 random words._

![SMAPP: confirming 12 words](smesh-4-wallet-9.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Drag and drop the 4 words on the left to their corresponding slots._

![SMAPP: confirmed 12 words](smesh-4-wallet-10.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Once you have completed the challenge, click "Done"._

![SMAPP: wallet created](smesh-4-wallet-11.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_You wallet has now been created, click "Go to Wallet"._

You can now go to your wallet panel, this is where you can check how many
Spacemesh coins you have collected.

![SMAPP: wallet panel](smesh-4-wallet-12.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_This is the wallet panel._

From this panel you can also transfer coins to other wallets.


## Connecting to the Network

SMAPP should automatically connect you to the Spacemesh network.

You can check if anything went wrong from the "Network" tab in the top;
there should be a green dot next to it.

If you click it, SMAPP will take you to the network panel, where you can check
the status and restart the node if anything went wrong.

![SMAPP: network panel](smesh-5-network.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_This is the network panel._


## Smeshing

### Proof of Space

Smeshing is a multi-step process, the first step is called _proof-of-space_ or
PoS, and it consists in filling some space with junk data.

Everything comes with a cost, and the cost you pay for smeshing is this junk
data, or rather, the price you pay is the price of the disk that provides the
space that you use to store this junk data.

Once you are ready to generate the PoST data, click "Smeshing" on the top to
go to the smeshing panel.

![SMAPP: ready to smesh](smesh-6-smeshing-1.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_From the smeshing panel, click "Setup Proof of Space"._

![SMAPP: proof of space directory](smesh-6-smeshing-2.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Select the directory where you want to store your data, and click "Next"._

It's time to pick a path where you want to store your data.

> Make sure that you have at least 256 GB of free space where you want to store
> your data. 256 GB is the minimum required to participate as a smesher.
{: .prompt-warning }

> You can keep this data on an external drive or a USB stick if you want, but
> you have to make sure that both the device and the cable you use to connect it
> to your PC are of good quality. If the device disconnects, you might lose your
> rewards.
{: .prompt-tip }

Generating the PoS data is a one-time operation. Once you have generated it,
it's yours to keep for as long as you want, and you will keep receiving rewards
for it and the space you have committed to store it.

### Proof of Space-Time

Once you have configured the path where your PoS data is stored, you have to
configure how much CPU power you want to allocated to _proof-of-space-time_ or
PoST.

Unlike PoS, which is a one-time operation, PoST is an operation that needs to be
repeated once every two weeks.

Now you have to choose how much CPU you want to allocate to PoST.

![SMAPP: benchmark](smesh-6-smeshing-3.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Click "Test chosen Options" and select the one you prefer, then click "Next"._

Choosing the right values is a bit tricky here. The idea is to choose the
options that use the least amount of CPU threads and nonces as possible, but
high enough to keep either your disk or the CPU usage as high as possible, but
always below 100%.

> To keep it simple, my personal recommendation is to pick the lowest suggested
> option where "Recommended PoS Size" is double of the space you want to
> allocate to smeshing.
>
> As an example, let's say that you want to allocate 1 TB to smeshing and your
> results are like in the previous screenshot, you should choose the second
> option.
>
> If you instead wanted to allocate only 256 GB, you should choose the first
> option.
{: .prompt-tip }

Remember that if you allocate more than the "Recommended PoS Size", your
computer might not be able to find a proof in enough time, and you might not
get any rewards for two weeks.

### Size

Now you can tell SMAPP how much space you want to allocate to smeshing.

![SMAPP: PoS size](smesh-6-smeshing-4.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Set the size and click "Next"._

The minimum space you can allocate is 256 GB, and each unit is 64 GB, so,
assuming you want to allocate 256 GB, you should allocate 4 units.

> 4 units × 64 GB/unit = 256 GB\
> 8 units × 64 GB/unit = 512 GB\
> 16 units × 64 GB/unit = 1 TB\
> etc...

> My personal recommendation is to start with 256 GB to understand how the
> process works. Unfortunately you can not change this size later, but still,
> since this operation might take longer than you expect, I would still
> recommend to start small, and then, eventually, if you feel like you want to,
> start over and go bigger.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Proof of Work

It's time for the _proof-of-work_ or PoW step in Spacemesh, which luckily only
has to be done once, since it's the most time and energy consuming step.

Let me repeat it again: you can also do it with a CPU, but it will take a
long time and probably waste more electricity than doing it with a gaming GPU.
If you don't have a gaming GPU, you should ask a friend of yours to lend you
theirs for a few hours, I have written a
[step-by-step guide to do smeshing from a friend's computer]({% post_url 2023-08-26-spacemesh-smeshing-with-friends %}).

![SMAPP: PoS processor](smesh-6-smeshing-5.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_The best option is already selected, just click "Next"._

### Last steps

SMAPP will now let you choose the address of the wallet where you want your
rewards to be deposited.

![SMAPP: rewards](smesh-6-smeshing-6.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_The address of your walled should be pre-compiled, just click "Next"._

And at last, it's time to press the final button!

![SMAPP: ready to create data](smesh-6-smeshing-7.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Everything is ready to go, click "Create Data"._

![SMAPP: generating data](smesh-6-smeshing-8.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Spacemesh is now crunching numbers, all you have to do now is wait..._

Spacemesh will start filling your space with the PoS data, it will take a few
hours to a few days depending on how much time you decided to allocate and how
powerful your GPU is.

### Proof of Extended Time

After a few hours Spacemesh should finish generating your data and will
automatically proceed to the next step: _proof-of-extended-time_ or PoET, to
prove that your space on the disk is still committed to Spacemesh.

![SMAPP: generating data](smesh-7-smeshing-poet.png){: .shadow w='1316' h='763' }
_Initialization completed._

You are done. For as long as you keep SMAPP running and you don't delete your
PoS data, you will keep receiving rewards.

You don't need to pay too much attention to what's written on this panel.
As long as all the dots are green, everything should be alright.
