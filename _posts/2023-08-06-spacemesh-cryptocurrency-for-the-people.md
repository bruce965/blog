Starting August 11th 2023, [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/), the
cryptocurrency for the people, officially starts circulating.


## What is Spacemesh?

It's a novel _layer-one_ crypto protocol with the goal to fix the issues of
Bitcoin and Etherium, all while being easy and cheap for everyone to join,
with the hardware that you already posses; no money investment necessary.


## How does it work?

{: .prompt-tip }

To keep it simple, like "regular" currencies, cryptocurrencies are (or were?)
backed by the value of some physical assets.

In the case of **Bitcoin**, the value is backed by that of computing power and
electricity invested to mine the coins, this is called _proof-of-work_ or PoW;
Bitcoin works like a lottery, only a few people win each "round".
Unfortunately this means that to join Bitcoin mining, you would have to invest
into hardware powerful enough to be competitive with the rest of the miners,
this is a very steep barriers for newcomers.
Also, Bitcoin is bad for the environment, because so much electricity has to be
globally wasted to power the mining hardware (_ASICs_).

In the case of **Ethereum**, the value comes from people staking their wealth
while signing legitimate transactions, and rejecting fraudulent ones, this is
called _proof-of-stake_ or PoS.
The power consumption and hardware requirement to join the Ethereum miners is
much lower, and unlike with Bitcoins' lottery, with Ethereum everybody receives
rewards in a fair and predictable way; unfortunately the barrier is still quite
steep: to become a miner you must posses some wealth, or buy Ethereum tokens
from someone who is willing to sell you some, usually for a high price.

**Spacemesh** is different, all you need to become a miner is some free space on
your hard drive, a computer that stays on most of the time, and a decent gaming
GPU that you will need to use just for one time (you can ask a friend to lend
you one for a few days if you don't have one).
This model is called _proof-of-space-time_ or PoST and the value of Spacemesh
comes from the space that you decide to commit on your computer's hard disk.
Like with Ethereum, it's not a lottery, everybody is guaranteed to receive
rewards proportional to the amount of space they committed to the network.
Anyone can become a Spacemesh miner (_smesher_) without any monetary investment,
nor with the need to purchase any new hardware, and the only electricity you
will have to pay for is the one for the initial mining, generally a few cents,
and to keep your computer powered on most of the time: usually as much as a few
light bulbs, depending how much energy your computer consumes when idle.


## What do I need to join?

The requirements to join the Spacemesh network are minimal:

- A modern-ish computer, any computer built in the last 8 years should be okay
- At least 256 GB of free space available, permanently committed to Spacemesh
- Just for one time: a gaming GPU, low-end is okay but high-end will be faster


## How do I join?

If you have a gaming GPU on your computer, all you have to do is:

1. Download and run the latest version of [SMAPP](https://spacemesh.io/);
2. Follow the instruction the app gives you.

That's it. Welcome to the smeshers community! 😁

If something is not clear, I have written a detailed
[step-by-step SMAPP smeshing guide]({% post_url 2023-08-06-spacemesh-smapp-smeshing %}),
with screenshots for every single click you should make.

If you don't have a gaming GPU, the process has a few more steps: you will need
to borrow from a friend for a few hours a gaming PC with a gaming GPU.

I have also written a
[step-by-step guide to do smeshing from a friend's computer]({% post_url 2023-08-26-spacemesh-smeshing-with-friends %}).

If you don't have a gaming GPU and you don't have any friends with a gaming GPU,
you can also do it with a CPU with SMAPP, but be warned: it might take a long
time (up to a few days) and will end up wasting few KWh in electricity.
If you have means to do it with a GPU you really should, it's better for the
environment and takes much less time; and remember, you will need the GPU only
one time for a few hours.


## When will I start getting coins?

Once you have become a smesher, you will have to wait for the first PoET round,
which happens every two Sundays at 8:00 AM UTC.

Once the PoET round starts, you will have 12 hours to verify your PoS data
and submit your proof.
SMAPP will do this automatically for you, but it's very important that your
computer is powered on during this time window.

14 days later (two Sundays later), you will have to verify that you still have
your PoS data on your drive, so it's important again that your computer is
powered on during this time window.

10 days later, you will start receiving rewards. You will keep receiving rewards
for 14 days all the time your computer is powered on. You can temporarily turn
it off during these 14 days, and you will temporarily stop receiving rewards,
but you will resume receiving rewards as soon as you turn it back on.


## Is there something I need to be aware of?

That's it. Just keep the SMAPP running and you will keep receiving rewards.

You will keep receiving rewards forever as long as you submit PoET proofs every
two weeks, remember that you will absolutely have to keep your computer powered
and connected to the internet during this 12 hours proof time window.

During the bi-weekly proving window, your computer will have to perform heavy
computations, this might take from a few minutes up to 12 hours depending on
how fast your computer is and how much space you committed to Spacemesh; during
this time period your computer might become less responsive, so you might not
be able to use it for heavy gaming.


## What now?

For now it's very early, by the time I'm writing this guide there are no coins
in circulation yet. Once coins will start circulating, people will start
building things with them, a market will emerge, and you will be able to
exchange Spacemesh coins for goods and services, as well as for other
cryptocurrencies and "regular" currencies.

If you have questions, feel free to
[join Spacemesh on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yVhQ7rC), you will find
smeshers excited to help each other out.

Happy smeshing! 🎉
