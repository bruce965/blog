Apologies, I was planning to write this guide today 2023-08-06, but I didn't
have enough time. I will do my best to write it in the coming weeks.

For now, please refer to my article
["Spacemesh: Smeshing with SMAPP"]({% post_url 2023-08-06-spacemesh-smapp-smeshing %}).
The only difference between that procedure is that after generating the PoS data
on your friends' computer is that you will have to transfer everything to your
computer and delete everything from theirs.

On Windows you will find the SMAPP data by pressing `WinKey + R` and typing
`%AppData%\Spacemesh`. This is the folder that you should transfer.

Thanks for your understanding, please stay tuned. üôè

If you have questions, feel free to
[join Spacemesh on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yVhQ7rC), you will find
smeshers excited to help each other out.
